# -Lung-Cancer-Risk-Prediction-Model-SVM-
This repository contains a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting lung cancer risk levels in non-smokers based on genetic alterations such as Fraction Genome Altered (FGA), Mutation Count, and Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB). The adopted dataset was retrieved from Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (MSK, J Clin Oncol 2018).
